# Snake Game

This Java Snake game, built with Swing, challenges players to navigate a snake using arrow keys, eat food to grow, and avoid collisions with the walls and itself. It features game-over logic and real-time score tracking, making it a valuable example for learning Java GUI design and basic game development principles.
